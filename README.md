Company Web Application - First Aid Responder Training
This website will allow users to browse a few pages to find out info about the company and the courses it provides. It also allows a visitor to book a course.

The administrator of the website will be able to log in and view who has booked into courses. The administrator can add and remove courses also.

This is a simple company website that is written in HTML5 and CSS using the Bootstrap framework and AngularJS. Javascript will be used for the client and frontend. NodeJS javscript app server will be used for the backend to hook up to the MonjoDB.

All work was done by Jonathan McDonald during the period of March, April & May 2016
